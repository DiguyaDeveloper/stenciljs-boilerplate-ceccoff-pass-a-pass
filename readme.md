# Ceccoff Stencil Design System Boilerplate

This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil.

Stencil is also great for building entire apps. For that, use the [stencil-app-starter](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-app-starter) instead.

## Getting Started

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-component-starter.git my-component
cd my-component
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Using this component

There are three strategies we recommend for using web components built with Stencil.

The first step for all three of these strategies is to [publish to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

### Script tag

- Put a script tag similar to this `<script src='https://unpkg.com/my-component@0.0.1/dist/my-component.esm.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### Node Modules

- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Put a script tag similar to this `<script src='node_modules/my-component/dist/my-component.esm.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### In a stencil-starter app

- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Add an import to the npm packages `import my-component;`
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc
